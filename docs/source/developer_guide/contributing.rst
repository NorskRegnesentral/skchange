Contributing
============
After setting up your development environment as described in the
:doc:`setup`, you are ready to start contributing to Skchange!
This guide provides best practices for contributing code, reporting issues,
and submitting pull requests.

Reporting bugs
--------------


Suggesting enhancements
-----------------------


Working on an issue
-------------------
When working on an issue, you should create a new branch from the ``main`` branch in
your local, forked repository. Then start coding!

Remember that every commit is checked by ``pre-commit``.

When writing git commit messages, we encourage the use of `Conventional Commits
<https://www.conventionalcommits.org>`_.
