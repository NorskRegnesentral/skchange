Contributing
============
After setting up your development environment as described in the
:doc:`setup`, you are ready to start contributing to Skchange!
This guide provides best practices for contributing code, reporting issues,
and submitting pull requests.

Reporting bugs and requesting features
--------------------------------------
We use `GitHub issues <https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/skchange/issues>`_ to track
bugs and feature requests.

Before opening a new issue, please search the existing issues to see if your
problem or idea has already been reported.

In your bug report, please include as many details as possible.

In your feature request, please describe the behaviour you want and why.
Also provide a code example of before (if applicable) and after the feature is
implemented.


Working on an issue
-------------------
When working on an issue, you should create a new branch from the ``main`` branch in
your local, forked repository. The branch name should be descriptive of the work you
are doing, e.g., ``fix-issue-123`` or ``add-feature-xyz``.

Remember that every commit is checked by ``pre-commit``.

When writing git commit messages, we encourage the use of `Conventional Commits
<https://www.conventionalcommits.org>`_.
