Reporting bugs and requesting features
--------------------------------------
We use `GitHub issues <https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/skchange/issues>`_ to track
bugs and feature requests.

Before opening a new issue, please search the existing issues to see if your
problem or idea has already been reported.

In your bug report, please include as many details as possible.

In your feature request, please describe the behaviour you want and why.
Also provide a code example of before (if applicable) and after the feature is
implemented.

The following sections provide detailed instructions on how to contribute code to Skchange effectively.
