"""Factory for getting test statistic functions and their initializers from strings.

Recipe for adding new scores:
    1. Add a new module in skchange.score: <score_name>_score.py
    2. Add two functions:
        init_<score_name>_score, which precomputes quantities that should be
        precomputed, often partial sums and such.
        <score_name>_score, which takes in the output of init_<score_name>_score as its
        first argument, and start, end and split indices as the second, third and
        fourth arguments.
    3. Add the name of the score to VALID_CHANGE_SCORES below.
    4. Add the name of the score to the docstring of score_factory below.
    4. Add a new if-statement in score_factory below.

        Test statistic to use for changepoint detection.
        * If "mean", the difference-in-mean statistic is used,
